Outside-In TDD with Acceptance Tests
====================================
 
### Objective

Learn and practice the double loop of TDD
Test application from outside, identifying side effects
 
### Problem description - Bank kata
 
Create a simple bank application with the following features:

     - Deposit into Account
     - Withdraw from an Account
     - Print a bank statement to the console
 
## Acceptance criteria

Statement should have transactions in the following format:

>	DATE       | AMOUNT  | BALANCE
>	10/04/2014 | 500.00  | 1400.00
>	02/04/2014 | -100.00 | 900.00
>	01/04/2014 | 1000.00 | 1000.00

## Starting point and constraints

Start with a class the following structure:

    public class Account {

        public void deposit(int amount);

        public void withdrawal(int amount);

        public void printStatement();

    }

You are not allowed to add any other public method to this class.

**NOTE:** In order to keep the exercise simple, use _int_ for money and _String_ for dates.
Also, you can ignore the formatting of the statement (spaces between pipes and words, etc).
